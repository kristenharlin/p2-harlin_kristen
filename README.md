## Issues

I had issues which I emailed about regarding how to select my sections. Other than that, my issues were trial and error with running the code, code order, and playing with if/else statements to make sure things looped when I wanted them. My issues were mostly just trial and error and I figured them out on my own. I had a hard time determining how to structure the second click functionality.

Finally, I used this to help me remember the method for converting the string to an integer.
